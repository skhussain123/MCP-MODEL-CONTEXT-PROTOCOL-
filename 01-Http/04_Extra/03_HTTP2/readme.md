# HTTP/2: Faster and More Efficient Web Communication

https://github.com/panaversity/learn-agentic-ai/tree/main/03_ai_protocols/01_mcp/extra/03_HTTP2/http_code

HTTP/2, standardized in RFC 9113, significantly improves web performance over HTTP/1.1 by introducing multiplexing, header compression, and a binary framing layer. This guide focuses on practicing with HTTP/2 using **HTTP/2 Cleartext (h2c)** for simplicity in local, non-browser scenarios, and also covers HTTP/2 over TLS (HTTPS) for browser compatibility.

## Core Problem Addressed: HTTP/1.1 Limitations

(As detailed in "HTTP Basics") HTTP/1.1 struggled with Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking, inefficient connection use, and verbose headers. HTTP/2 resolves many of these by using a single, more capable TCP connection.

---

## Key HTTP/2 Features & Practical Impacts

1.  **Binary Framing Layer**: HTTP/2 messages are binary frames, enabling efficient parsing and features like multiplexing.
2.  **Multiplexing & Streams**: Multiple requests/responses concurrently over a single TCP connection, each in its own stream. Eliminates HTTP-level HOL blocking, speeding up resource-heavy pages.
3.  **Header Compression (HPACK)**: Reduces data transfer by compressing redundant headers.
4.  **Server Push (Primarily HTTPS)**: Servers can proactively send resources. More common and reliable over HTTPS.
5.  **Stream Prioritization**: Clients can suggest resource priority.

## Setting Up for HTTP/2 Practice (h2c Focus)

Our primary example will use HTTP/2 Cleartext (h2c) which doesn't require TLS certificates, simplifying initial local testing between a programmatic client and server.

### 1. Install Python Tools (using `uv`)

Use a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv init http_code
cd http_code
# Install httpx (HTTP client with H2 support),
# FastAPI (web framework), and Hypercorn (ASGI server)
uv add "httpx[http2]" "fastapi[standard]" hypercorn
```
_Note: We install `uvicorn` as it's commonly used with FastAPI, but `hypercorn` is what we'll use to serve with HTTP/2 capabilities, including h2c._

---

## HTTP/2 Cleartext (h2c) Python Examples

These examples demonstrate HTTP/2 without TLS encryption.

### Example 1: HTTP/2 (h2c) Server with FastAPI (`server_h2c.py`)

Create a file named `server_h2c.py`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root(request: Request):
    print(f"--- Request headers: {request.headers} ---")
    http_version = request.scope.get('http_version', None)
    print(f"--- HTTP version: {http_version} ---")
    request_client = request.client
    
    client_host = None
    client_port = None
    
    if request_client:
        client_host = request_client.host
        client_port = request_client.port
    
    headers = dict(request.headers)
    return {
        "message": "Hello from FastAPI over HTTP/2 Cleartext (h2c)!",
        "http_version_detected": http_version,
        "client": f"{client_host}:{client_port}",
        "request_headers": headers
    }

@app.post("/data")
async def create_data(request: Request, payload: dict):
    request_client = request.client
    
    client_host = None
    client_port = None
    
    if request_client:
        client_host = request_client.host
        client_port = request_client.port
    
    http_version = request.scope.get('http_version', None)
    return {
        "message": "Data received successfully via h2c!",
        "http_version_detected": http_version,
        "received_payload": payload,
        "client": f"{client_host}:{client_port}"
    }
```

**Running the h2c Server:**
Ensure `hypercorn` is installed. In your terminal:

```bash
uv run hypercorn server_h2c:app --bind "0.0.0.0:8000"       
```

This tells Hypercorn to serve your FastAPI app and allow HTTP/2 Cleartext connections on port 5000.

### Example 2: HTTP/2 (h2c) Client (`client_h2c.py`)

Create a file named `client_h2c.py`:

```python
import httpx
import asyncio

SERVER_URL_H2C = "http://localhost:8000" # Note: http:// for h2c

async def main():
    # For h2c, http2=True is essential. httpx will attempt the h2c upgrade.
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(http2=True, http1=False) as client:
        print(f"--- Testing GET request to {SERVER_URL_H2C}/ (expecting h2c) ---")
        try:
            response_get = await client.get(f"{SERVER_URL_H2C}/")
            response_get.raise_for_status()
            print(f"Status: {response_get.status_code}, HTTP Version: {response_get.http_version}")
            print(f"Response JSON:\n{response_get.json()}\n")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"GET request to h2c server failed: {type(e).__name__} - {e}")

        print(f"--- Testing POST request to {SERVER_URL_H2C}/data (expecting h2c) ---")
        try:
            post_payload = {"agent_id": "007-h2c", "task": "observe_cleartext"}
            response_post = await client.post(f"{SERVER_URL_H2C}/data", json=post_payload)
            response_post.raise_for_status()
            print(f"Status: {response_post.status_code}, HTTP Version: {response_post.http_version}")
            print(f"Response JSON:\n{response_post.json()}\n")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"POST request to h2c server failed: {type(e).__name__} - {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Running the h2c Client:**
Ensure the `server_h2c.py` server is running with Hypercorn. Then, in another terminal:

```bash
uv run python client_h2c.py
```

You should see `HTTP Version: HTTP/2` in the output if successful.

## How to Practice & Experiment (h2c Focus)

1.  **Run Local h2c Server & Client**:
    - Start `app_h2c.py` with the Hypercorn `h2-cleartext` command.
    - Execute `python client_h2c.py` to see it communicate over HTTP/2 without TLS.
2.  **`curl` with HTTP/2 Prior Knowledge (for h2c)**:

    - `curl` can speak h2c if told to use it directly (prior knowledge), as there's no ALPN negotiation for h2c in the same way as HTTPS.

    ```bash
    # Test GET to your local h2c server
    curl --http2-prior-knowledge http://localhost:8000/

    # Test POST to your local h2c server
    curl --http2-prior-knowledge http://localhost:8000/data -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message":"Hello from curl h2c!"}'
    ```

    _You should see `HTTP/2 200` in `curl`'s verbose output (`-v` flag) if it connects with HTTP/2._

**Important Note on h2c**: HTTP/2 Cleartext (h2c) is generally used in trusted environments (e.g., between backend services) or for local testing. It lacks the encryption of HTTPS. **Web browsers do not support h2c.**

## HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2: Key Differences Summary

(Table similar to previous version, emphasizing binary, multiplexing, single connection, HPACK, browser TLS requirement)

| Feature           | HTTP/1.1                          | HTTP/2                                              |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **Protocol Type** | Text-based                        | Binary-based (frames)                               |
| **Connections**   | Multiple TCP connections per host | Single TCP connection per host                      |
| **Multiplexing**  | No (or problematic pipelining)    | Yes (multiple requests/responses on one connection) |
| **HOL Blocking**  | Yes (at application & TCP layer)  | Solved at application layer; TCP HOL remains        |
| **Header Format** | Plain text, often redundant       | Compressed (HPACK)                                  |
| **Security**      | Optional (HTTPS for encryption)   | Effectively mandatory TLS for browser support       |

## Strengths & Weaknesses of HTTP/2

**Strengths**:

- Significant Performance Boost (especially with HTTPS).
- Efficient Network Use.

**Weaknesses**:

- TCP Head-of-Line Blocking (main problem HTTP/3 solves).
- Server Push Complexity.

## HTTP/2 in Agentic AI Systems (DACA Context)

HTTP/2 (both h2c for trusted backends and HTTPS for browser/external) is vital for DACA:

- **h2c**: Efficient for internal, trusted agent-to-agent or agent-to-service communication where TLS overhead is not desired and network is secure.
- **HTTPS/2**: Standard for exposing UIs, external APIs, and when interacting with most third-party services or browsers.
- gRPC (which uses HTTP/2) is excellent for strongly-typed microservice communication.

# Server-Sent Events (SSE): A Guide to Real-Time Web Communication

https://github.com/panaversity/learn-agentic-ai/tree/main/03_ai_protocols/01_mcp/extra/11_SSE

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a simple, efficient, and standard W3C technology that enables servers to push real-time updates to clients over a single, long-lived HTTP connection. Unlike WebSockets, SSE is primarily a one-way communication channel from server to client, making it well-suited for scenarios where the server needs to send continuous data streams or notifications without complex client-side requests.

This document explores the fundamentals of SSE as a general web technology, its core concepts, how to implement it in Python using FastAPI and `httpx`, and its potential applications, particularly in agentic systems like those envisioned by DACA.

## Understanding Server-Sent Events (SSE)

SSE allows a web page (or any HTTP client) to get automatic updates from a server via an HTTP connection. Once the connection is established, the server can send data to the client whenever new information is available.

### How SSE Works

1.  **Client Initiates Connection**: The client (e.g., a browser using the `EventSource` API or a custom HTTP client like Python's `httpx`) makes a standard HTTP `GET` request to a specific endpoint on the server.
2.  **Server Establishes Persistent Connection**: The server accepts the connection and keeps it open. It responds with a `Content-Type` of `text/event-stream`.
3.  **Server Pushes Events**: The server sends data in a specific plain text format (UTF-8). Each event is a block of text, typically ending with a double newline (`\\n\\n`).
4.  **Client Processes Events**: The client receives these events and processes them. Browser-based `EventSource` APIs automatically handle parsing and reconnection. Custom clients need to implement this logic.

### Key Features

- **Unidirectional (Primarily)**: Data flows from server to client over the SSE connection. Client-to-server communication typically uses separate HTTP requests (e.g., `POST` to a different endpoint).
- **HTTP-Based**: Uses standard HTTP, making it compatible with existing web infrastructure.
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Browser-based `EventSource` clients automatically attempt to reconnect if the connection is lost, using the `retry` field if provided by the server. Custom clients must implement their own reconnection logic.
- **Event Types**: Events can be named, allowing clients to listen for and react to specific types of messages.
- **Text-Based**: Designed for UTF-8 encoded text. Binary data needs encoding (e.g., Base64).

---

## Event Stream Format

The event stream is a simple stream of text data. Messages are generally separated by a double newline.

### MIME Type

The server **MUST** send the `Content-Type: text/event-stream` header.

### Message Structure

Each message can consist of one or more field-value pairs, with each field on a new line:

- `event`: (Optional) A string identifying the type of event. If specified, clients can listen for this specific event type (e.g., `event: user_login`). If omitted, it's a generic `message` event.
- `data`: (Required for most events) The data payload for the event. If a message has multiple `data:` lines, they are concatenated by the client with a newline character in between to form a single data string.
- `id`: (Optional) A unique ID for the event. If the client reconnects, it will send the `Last-Event-ID` HTTP header with the value of the last received ID, allowing the server to potentially resume the stream.
- `retry`: (Optional) An integer specifying the reconnection time in milliseconds for the client.

### Comments

Lines starting with a colon (`:`) are comments and are ignored by the client. They can act as keep-alive pings.

```
: This is a comment

event: user_update
data: {"username": "jane_doe", "status": "active"}
id: event-001

data: This is a multi-line
data: message payload.
id: event-002

retry: 10000
```

A complete event is typically terminated by an empty line (a double newline).

Custom HTTP clients in languages like Python (`httpx`, `requests` with streaming) can also consume SSE streams by handling the `text/event-stream` response and parsing the data line by line.

## Python Implementation: SSE Server and Client

The following examples demonstrate a practical SSE setup using Python with FastAPI for the server and `httpx` for the client. This system allows the server to push events and also enables the client to send messages to the server via a separate `POST` request, with the server then acknowledging or responding via SSE.

### Example 1: Runnable Python SSE Server (FastAPI)

This server provides an endpoint (`/sse_stream`) for clients to establish an SSE connection. It assigns a session ID and can push various event types. It also has a `/send_message` endpoint where clients can `POST` data; the server then pushes a "message_receipt" event back to the client via its SSE stream.

3.  Run from your terminal: `uv run python python_sse_server.py`

### Example 2: Runnable Python SSE Client (httpx)

This client connects to the server's `/sse_stream` endpoint. It first receives a `connection_confirmation` event containing its session ID. Then, it can send messages to the server's `/send_message` `POST` endpoint and will receive `message_receipt` events via its active SSE stream. It will also receive periodic mock AI agent messages.

## General Strengths of SSE

- **Simplicity**: Easier to implement for server-to-client push compared to WebSockets, especially when full bidirectionality isn't needed on the same channel.
- **HTTP-Based**: Works over standard HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2, avoiding complex firewall configurations sometimes needed for `ws://`.
- **Automatic Reconnection (Browsers)**: `EventSource` API handles dropped connections gracefully. Custom clients need to implement this.
- **Standardized**: A W3C standard with good browser support.
- **Efficiency**: Can be more efficient than polling for server-to-client updates.

---

## General Weaknesses and Considerations of SSE

- **Unidirectional Stream**: The SSE connection itself is for server-to-client data. Client-to-server messages require a separate mechanism (e.g., HTTP POST, as shown in the example).
- **Maximum Connections Limit (HTTP/1.1)**: Browsers typically limit concurrent open HTTP/1.1 connections per domain (around 6). This can be an issue for apps with many SSE streams. HTTP/2 multiplexing largely mitigates this.
- **Proxy/Firewall Buffering**: Some intermediaries might buffer `text/event-stream` responses, delaying or breaking the stream.
- **No Native Binary Support**: SSE is for UTF-8 text. Binary data must be encoded (e.g., Base64).

---

## Server-Sent Events in Generic Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication

SSE is a viable technology for certain types of Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication, especially for unidirectional information push.

### Potential Roles & Use Cases in A2A:

1.  **Notification Streams**: Agent A exposes an SSE endpoint. Agents B and C subscribe to receive real-time notifications or status updates from Agent A (e.g., a monitoring agent streaming health metrics).
2.  **One-Way Data Feeds**: An agent continuously produces data (e.g., market data agent) that other agents consume.
3.  **Log Streaming**: An agent streams its operational logs via SSE to a logging agent or diagnostics UI.

### Complementing SSE for A2A:

Since SSE is server-to-client, if Agent B (client) needs to send commands or data back to Agent A (server), a separate HTTP channel (like a `POST` endpoint on Agent A) is typically used, as demonstrated in the Python examples. Agent A can then correlate the `POST` request (e.g., using a session ID) and push related updates or responses back via the client's SSE stream.

---

## Selection Criteria for SSE in DACA

Within the Dapr Agentic Cloud Ascent (DACA) framework, SSE is a useful tool for specific communication patterns:

**When to Consider SSE for A2A or other DACA components:**

1.  **Primarily Server-to-Client Push Needed**: If the core requirement is for an agent (server) to push updates to other agents or UIs (clients).
2.  **Simplicity for Unidirectional Push**: When a lightweight mechanism is preferred.
3.  **Leveraging HTTP Infrastructure**: Beneficial when working within standard HTTP environments.
4.  **Broadcasting Events**: Ideal for one-to-many event dissemination.

**Considerations for DACA:**

- **Scalability**: Dapr can manage the scalability of agent services exposing SSE endpoints.
- **Resilience**: For custom clients (`httpx`), implement robust reconnection logic.
- **Not for Full Duplex over Single Channel**: For rich, bidirectional, request-response over a single persistent channel where either side can initiate freely, WebSockets or HTTP/2+ patterns might be more direct.
- **Security**: Secure with mTLS (via Dapr) and application-level authentication/authorization.

**In summary for DACA**: SSE is a valuable, simple technology for one-way data push. It's a good choice for A2A notification streams, live data feeds, or any DACA scenario where an agent needs to efficiently push updates to consumers over HTTP, often complemented by a separate client-to-server POST channel for commands or client data submission.
